The origin of my time on Earth located itself in Palo Alto, California, just south of San Francisco; four years after I was born, my family and I moved to the western suburbs of Minneapolis, Minnesota where I would spend  the remainder of my childhood and adolescence. My childhood bore few eccentricities yet was perennially marked with an interest in mathematics and science. Among other typical childhood interests, many a day I spent paging through scientific magazines or my mother's (a high school biology teacher) textbooks. While I had no specific intentions as to my future career, I always felt that I would be a scientist of some sort.

As I grew into my early teen years, I further pursued my scientific interests through activities such as Science Olympiad (an interscholastic set of scientific competitions), Math League, and reading the *Elegant Universe*, a book by Brian Greene covering topics such as relativity and quantum physics. I was also introduced to musical performance via  In addition to these more intellectual endeavors, I enjoyed my fair share of video games, tennis, and most anything to do with the outdoors.

Along with the aforementioned interests and activities I acquired a love of both computer programming and philosophy in high school which have both grown into some of the most significant areas of my life. Accordingly, I turned both into my fields of study when I moved out to Poughkeepsie, New York for my undergraduate education which I am in the process of currently. I now spend my days programming, philosophizing, snowboarding, composing, fencing, and quite a bit more, but this a woefully cursory description of my interests; I highly recommend visiting my dedicated [interests](/Interests/) page to learn more.
