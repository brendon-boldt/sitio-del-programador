I completed my high school education at Providence Academy in Plymouth, Minnesota; while the school did not offer anything by way of software development or computer science, it gave a strong educational foundation teaching how to use logic both concretely and abstractly to solve any sort of problem. During my time in high school, I also took classes through the University of Minnesota â€“ Twin Cities including differential and integral calculus, linear algebra, Latin poetry and prose, and Ancient Greek.

After completing high school, I made my way to Marist College, a small liberal arts school with a growing computer science program, located on the Hudson River in Poughkeepsie, New York. I am planning to graduate in the spring of 2018 with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and a Bachelor of Arts in Philosophy (I would love to add a mathematics minor, but my double major keeping rather busy already).

While my heart is not yet set on this, I will likely pursue a doctorate in computer science or a related field after I have completed my bachelor's degrees. I do not yet know where I would go, but I would certainly pounce on the opportunity to see another part of the country or even the world.
