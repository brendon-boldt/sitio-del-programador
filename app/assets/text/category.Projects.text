By trade and by interest, I am a software developer; I believe there is no better way to describe than by demonstration. You can see an assortment of projects that I have worked on for school, for hackathons, and, most of all, for fun. In fact, this whole website is a creation of mine powered by the wonderful framework Ruby on Rails.

I have worked on everything from Javascript games, to sockets in C++, to OS design in x86 Assemblyâ€”variety is truly the spice of developer's life.
